# MIMIC-IV-ICU-Length-of-Stay-Prediction
This project predicts whether a patient's second ICU stay will be prolonged. It combines structured data from the first ICU admission with unstructured discharge notes to improve prediction accuracy. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, machine learning models training and a Streamlit app for interactive exploration.
